# todo-list

In this project I create a todo-list page where you can set tasks, set things 
like title, description, notes, priority, dueDate and link them to a project.
You can create projects with title and priority.
You can select tasks from today, tomorrow and from next week.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, npm and webpack.
